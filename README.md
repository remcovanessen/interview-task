# interview task

brief:

We’d like you to carry out a skills task in advance of your interview, that will be assessed as part of the recruitment process. The task is to take a flat website design and code it up into a functioning web page. This must be completed before the day of the interview.

We have supplied Sketch and Photoshop files of the design along with the fonts used in the design (see brief folder). The fonts used are Montseratt and Open Sans. These are both available on Google Fonts so can be imported onto the web page itself.

The carousel should function (even if the content and image is the same for each item), and a JavaScript / jQuery plugin can be used. The layout should respond nicely at different widths. We’d like you to add a class to the <body> once the page has finished loading. When a photo for a team member is clicked on, the photo should change to a solid colour. When it is clicked on again, it should change back to the photo.

All files (source files and final web page) to be provided as a ZIP file or on a Git repo. The web page can also me made available online prior to the interview if you wish. We’d like you to talk through the development as part of the interview.
